# Mexico For World README

README created by ChatGBT

Welcome to my React project! This README will guide you through the installation and running process.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages for both the client and server, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to install the client packages:

`npm run install:client`

4. After the client packages are installed successfully, run the following command to install the server packages:

`npm run install:server`

## Usage

To run the project, you need to start both the client and server. Follow the instructions below:

### Run Client

To run the client application, execute the following command:

`npm run start:client`

This command will start the development server for the client-side of the application. You can access the client in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port if specified).

### Run Server

To run the server, execute the following command:

`npm run start:server`

This command will start the server-side of the application. Make sure the server is running before interacting with the client. The server might be accessible on a different URL or port depending on your configuration.

### Run Server without SQL

If you don't need to use SQL for your server, there is an alternative script available to run the server. Execute the following command:

`npm run start:fake:server`

## Additional Information

- If you encounter any issues during the installation or running process, please check the console output for error messages and refer to the project documentation for troubleshooting.
- Ensure that you have a compatible version of Node.js installed on your machine.
- Make sure to configure any environment variables or settings required by the project. Refer to the project's documentation or configuration files for more information.
